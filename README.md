# Jira OWASP Top 10 awareness app

This project is to help build developer awareness on the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks.  
The app will pick one of the top 10 web app security risks when opened.  The idea is that developers will
learn about the top 10 security problem areas as they go about their daily development work.

The OWASP Top Ten can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/
